## Help and Support

Please contact me or file an issue here if you encounter any problems with the library or have suggestions! 

## Installing with NuGet

Due to some unforseen issues with NuGet, you may need to download and add sqlite3.dll to your project manually.  Set it to copy to output always.

## Under the Hood

The Watson Dedupe library will take an incoming byte array (which you give an object key name) and utilize a sliding window performing MD5 calculations over the data in the window to identify breakpoints in the data (this is called 'chunking').  Each chunk of data is assigned a chunk key (based on the SHA256 of the data).  MD5 is used for breakpoint identification for speed, and SHA256 is used for key assignment to practically eliminate the likelihood of hash collisions.  Tables in a Sqlite database are maintained to indicate which object keys map to which chunk keys and their ordering/position.  Chunks are stored in a directory you specify.  On retrieval, the object key data is retrieved from the index, the appropriate chunk keys are retrieved, and the object is reconstructed.  As long as the chunk data is consistent across analyzed data sets, identical chunk keys will be created, meaning duplicate data chunks are only stored once.  Further, each chunk key has a separate associated reference count to ensure that chunks are not garbage collected when a referencing object is deleted should another object also hold that reference.

## Two Libraries

Two libraries are included in the ```WatsonDedupe``` namespace:

- DedupeLibrary - one single repository (database) useful for smaller objects and chunk counts where the number of database rows will not impede performance.  Use this library for small deployments with few objects and few chunks.
- DedupeLibraryXL - one master database referencing one or more container databases.  Useful for larger objects or larger chunk sets where the row count would otherwise impede performance.  Use this libray for larger deployments.

The examples below are for DedupeLibrary.  The method signatures for DedupeLibraryXL are very similar, but the store, retrieve, and delete methods require the container name, container index filename as parameters, whereas these are not required in DedupeLibrary.  DedupeLibraryXL will automatically create containers when objects are stored, and remove the containers (and container file) when they are empty.

## Test App 

Test projects are included for both DedupeLibrary and DedupeLibraryXL which will help you exercise either of the class libraries.  A test GUI app also exists (see https://github.com/jchristn/WatsonDedupeUI).

## CLI

CLI projects are also included which provide a binary that can be used to interact with an index of either type (DedupeLibrary or DedupeLibraryXL) for object storage, retrieval, removal, and statistics.  CLI examples for DedupeLibrary are shown below.

## Library Example

The library requires that you implement three functions within your app for managing chunk data, specifically, writing, reading, and deleting.  This was done to provide you with flexibility on where you store chunk data and how you manage it.  

Be sure to create the directory 'Chunks' prior to execution, and include a text file named 'kjv.txt' in the output directory (you can use the ```bible.txt``` file from the SampleData folder for this purpose, but rename it).

            if (Dedupe.IndexStats(out NumObjects, out NumChunks, out LogicalBytes, out PhysicalBytes, out DedupeRatioX, out DedupeRatioPercent))

            }

            // Delete an object from the index
            if (Dedupe.DeleteObject(Key)) Console.WriteLine("Success");
        }

        // Called during store operations, consider using FileStream with FileOptions.WriteThrough to ensure crash consistency
        static bool WriteChunk(Chunk data)
        {
            File.WriteAllBytes("Chunks\\" + data.Key, data.Value);
            return true;
        }

        // Called during read operations
        static byte[] ReadChunk(string key)
        {
            return File.ReadAllBytes("Chunks\\" + key);
        }

        // Called during delete operations
        static bool DeleteChunk(string key)
        {
            File.Delete("Chunks\\" + key);
            return true;
        }
    }
}
```

## CLI Example
```
// Initialize new index
> dedupe test.idx create --params=128,4096,16,2

// Store an object
> dedupe test.idx store --chunks=chunks --key=obj1 < obj1.txt

// Retrieve an object
> dedupe test.idx retrieve --chunks=chunks --key=obj1 > obj1_new.txt

// Delete an object
> dedupe test.idx delete --chunks=chunks --key=obj1

// List objects
> dedupe test.idx list

// Check object existence
> dedupe test.idx exists --key=obj1

// Gather index stats
> dedupe test.idx stats
```

## Index Settings

Four parameters are used when creating the index: minimum chunk size, maximum chunk size, shift count, and boundary check bytes.  They are defined as follows:

- Minimum chunk size: the smallest amount of data that can be considered a chunk of data
- Maximum chunk size: the largest amount of data that can be considered a chunk of data
- Shift count: the number of bytes to move the sliding window while evaluating data in the window for a chunk boundary
- Boundary check bytes: the number of bytes in the MD5 hash of the data in the sliding window that is evaluated to identify a chunk boundary

The index parameters should be set in such a way to balance performance vs the frequency with which duplicate data is identified.  Generally speaking, the smaller the values for these, the more likely the library will be in finding repeated data patterns, and, the larger the values for these, the less likely the library will be in finding repeated data patterns.

Similarly, the smaller the value for these, the slower the library will perform, and the larger the value for these, the faster the library will perform.  Smaller values for these settings requires that more data be evaluated (via MD5) and more records be inserted into Sqlite.  Larger values for these settings requires less data analysis and fewer records inserted into Sqlite.

In some cases, it is assumed that duplicate data will not be found within a file and that the library should only be used to identify large chunks of redundant data across large objects (for instance, copies of files with minor changes).  In such cases, use large values for the index settings.

In other cases, where it is assumed that duplicate data will be found within a file and across files, smaller values can be used.

Recommended settings for most environments (min, max, shift, boundary):

- For small file environments, use 256, 4096, 16, and 2
- For large file environments, use 8192, 65536, 512, and 3
